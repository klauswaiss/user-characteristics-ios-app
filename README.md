This iOS app was created in June 2025 as an addition to my portfolio.

#### Features:

- Users can add/edit personal characteristics.
- Each characteristic has a name, value, optional reminder (local notification).
- Persistence of the data is done via SwiftData.
- Notification handling (local notifications) for the reminders.


#### Tools used:

## Architecture

- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern

## Running the App

- Minimum deployment: iOS 18.5

I recommend using Xcode 16+ to run the app in the Simulator.
